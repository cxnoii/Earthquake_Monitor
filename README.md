# Earthquake Monitor Application

## Overview
Utilizing Javascript, Leaflet.js, HTML, and GeoJSON in order to create a visualization to illustrate earthquakes across the globe. All data is coming from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The goal of this project is to make API calls from the USGS endpoints to create a map that will display earthquakes with a magnitude of 4.5 or higher and describe their location, depth, and magnitude. Additionally, tectonic plate boundaries will be visualized as a leaflet layer that can be toggled. The requests will be made using d3.json and the map visualization will be made using Leaflet.js.
